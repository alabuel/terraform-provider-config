# config Provider

The config Provider gives Terraform the ability to work with Excel worksheets, INI configuration files, and API response data.

Use the navigation on the left to read about the various data sources supported by the provider.

## Example Usage

The following example demonstrates a current basic usage of the provider.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    config = {
      source = "alabuel/config"
      version = "x.x.x"  # supply the version
    }
  }
}

provider "config" {}

data "config_workbook" "excel" {
  excel = "filename.xlsx"
  worksheet = "Sheet1"
}

data "config_restapi_get "apidata" {
  uri = "http://localhost:3000/posts"
}

data "config_ini" "cfg" {
  ini = file("configuration.ini")
}
```

See the sidebar for usage information on all the data sources, which will have examples specific to their own use cases.
